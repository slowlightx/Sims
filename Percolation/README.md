# Percolation Sim (Simple Version)


In the percolation.py, a Percolation class is implemented to simulate the percolation process for 2-dimension. And the critical probability for percolation I get is approximately 0.59. Here, I adopt the growing method where grids are flipped randomly. 


Figure_1.png shows the process.The deepest blue color represent those unvisited grids while the white represents those grids already visited. And there are two kinds of light blue colors which respectively represent those grids connected to the top or the bottom before and after the map is percolatable.
